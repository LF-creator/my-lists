# Shopping Lists


## Frontend project 2023
Group work in agile project methodology, where we acted as clients & designers for a weather application developed by one team, and as developers for a shopping list application designed by another team.

We worked with dynamic programming, Local Storage, JSON, API, and asynchronous code execution. The application is built mobile-first but also works well on desktop. Local Storage is used to simulate a login and allow a user to save their lists, which are stored in an API.
